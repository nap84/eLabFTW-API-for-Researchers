:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

* What tools aside from the browser can I use to make API requests?
* How can I authenticate myself?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

* Create an API token in the eLabFTW GUI
* Make a basic call to the eLabFTW API using the command line and curl
* Make user-specific API calls using the command line and curl and the API token

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Command-Line Interface

Using our browser isn't exactly useful when we want to automate workflows.

A useful, built-in tool is a command-line interface, terminal, prompt, shell, and so on. The terminology is rather specific to operating system and often used interchangeably. We're going to use terminal in the remainder of this course.

<!--Open one on your system:

**Mac**

  1. <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>spacebar</kbd> to open the search window
  2. type `terminal`
  3. <kbd>return</kbd>

**Windows**

   1. <kbd>windows</kbd> to open the menu
   2. type `cmd`
   3. select cmd to open

**Linux**

1. <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> is the default terminal shortcut for most distributions

    Alternatively:
   1. Search `shell` in your launcher
   2. click the terminal result to open.
-->

Open a new terminal in Jupyter Lab. (_Hint: if you already have a window open, use the blue `+` button in the top left corner of the Jupyter Lab window to open a new launcher. Then click the terminal icon._)

We will use a tool called [`cURL`](https://curl.se/) to make API calls. This is a typical tool used for data transfer.

We could head to its documentation to learn how to use it, but let's be lazy and use what we already have.

Head back [eLabFTW's API docs](https://doc.elabftw.net/api/). Choose the [HTML doc (v2)](https://doc.elabftw.net/api/elabapi-html/).

Similar to the Swagger page we saw in the previous episode, you will see the available endpoints on the left-hand pane, but now we have programmatic examples alongside them.

Scroll to the [Experiments](https://doc.elabftw.net/api/elabapi-html/#api-Experiments) section on the left and click [`postExperiment`](https://doc.elabftw.net/api/elabapi-html/#api-Experiments-postExperiment). On the right, cURL has already been selected in the example window. Let's use this to programmatically create and experiment:

1. Copy the text in the example window into a text editor in Jupyter Lab.
2. Edit the required info
   1. Create a token
      1. Head your eLabFTW instance
      2. click your initials on the top right-hand side
      3. click `settings`
      4. Select the `API KEYS` header
      5. Under `Create new key`, enter a name for your key and select `Read/Write` from the permissions drop-down menu.
      6. click `Generate an API Key`
      7. Copy and paste this to the `secrets.env` file in your `research_computer/` folder. It will only be shown once in the ELN!
   2. Copy and paste your token to the terminal, replacing `[[apiKey]]`
   3. Replace `https://elab.local:3148` with your eLabFTW URL
   4. Add experiment info using the template below. Once done, add `\` at the end of the last line, <kbd>enter</kbd> for a new line and add `-d '{"title":"my api exp"}` (replace info in curly brackets with full info)
   5. Copy and paste into your terminal
   6. Hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to run

Template for data:

_Feel free to modify!_

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

You can type this info directly into your terminal. For larger requests, however, especially when just starting out, it can be difficult to navigate. Thus, copy and pasting from a text editor may be easier and it is easier to catch problems.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

You can load the API key from the `secrets.env` file instead of pasting the secret into the command. From the `research_computer/` directory, run:

```bash
set -a
source research_computer/secrets.env
set +a
```

The `secrets.env` file should contain `ELAB_API_KEY` and `ELAB_API_HOST`. The key is
then available as the `$ELAB_API_KEY` environment variable. Use it in the
request like this:

```bash
curl -s -i -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: $ELAB_API_KEY" \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"title":"my api exp"}' \
   "$ELAB_API_HOST/experiments"
```

This keeps the token out of the command itself. Do not print the variable or share the `secrets.env` file. If you believe you unsafely used an API key, always revoke it and create a new one.


Note: `.env` is more common, however, Jupyter lab immediately hides these.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

What would the command line `cURL` API call look like that retrieves the experiment we just created? Write and execute this command. Then, analyze the response and see if everything is as you imagined.

Hint: use the experiment ID in the response from your last API call when building the URL for the request.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

The `POST` response includes the URL of the new experiment in its `Location`
header. Copy the experiment ID from that URL, then use it in a `GET` request:

```bash
curl -sS \
   -H "Authorization: $ELAB_API_KEY" \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   "$ELAB_API_HOST/experiments/<EXPERIMENT_ID>"
```

This prints the JSON response directly in the terminal. The response should
contain the experiment title and body, its creation and modification details,
the permission settings, and the values in `metadata.extra_fields`.

For more readable, indented JSON, you can pipe the response through `jq`:

```bash
curl -sS \
   -H "Authorization: $ELAB_API_KEY" \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   "$ELAB_API_HOST/experiments/<EXPERIMENT_ID>" | jq .
```

Here, `|` passes the response to `jq`, and `.` tells `jq` to display the
complete JSON document. If `jq` is not installed, install it with one of
these commands:

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install jq

# Debian or Ubuntu
sudo apt install jq

# Windows PowerShell with winget
winget install jqlang.jq
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `curl.exe` rather than `curl` to call cURL
explicitly, because `curl` may be an alias for a PowerShell command (shortened example):

```powershell
curl.exe ... | jq .
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Fill in the blanks for the the script in `research_computer/attach_measurement.sh` to attach the measurement file (`research_computer/measurement.csv`) to the created experiment.

This is an example of a bash script. There is both a commented and uncommented version. The commented version explains what each line does.

Ensure your `.env` file is set up with your API token and the API host URL.

Run the script with the experiment ID and the measurement file as arguments. For example:

```bash
./attach_measurement.sh 94 ./measurement.csv
```


:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

The upload endpoint expects `multipart/form-data`, so the file must be sent
with `-F`. Make it executable with `chmod +x attach_measurement.sh`, and run it with the experiment ID and
file:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
ENV_FILE="${ENV_FILE:-$SCRIPT_DIR/.env}"

if [[ -f "$ENV_FILE" ]]; then
      set -a
      source "$ENV_FILE"
      set +a
fi

: "${ELAB_API_HOST:?Set ELAB_API_HOST in $ENV_FILE or the environment}"
: "${ELAB_API_KEY:?Set ELAB_API_KEY in $ENV_FILE or the environment}"

EXPERIMENT_ID="${1:?Usage: $0 EXPERIMENT_ID MEASUREMENT_FILE}"
MEASUREMENT_FILE="${2:?Usage: $0 EXPERIMENT_ID MEASUREMENT_FILE}"

curl_options=(
      -H "Authorization: $ELAB_API_KEY"
      -F "file=@$MEASUREMENT_FILE"
      -F "comment=Temperature calibration measurement"
)

UPLOAD_URL="$ELAB_API_HOST/experiments/$EXPERIMENT_ID/uploads"
curl -sS -f -i "${curl_options[@]}" "$UPLOAD_URL"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

* API tokens authenticate requests made from the command line
* cURL can create, retrieve, and update data through the eLabFTW API
* API responses contain JSON data and HTTP headers that help interpret the result
* Environment variables and `.env` files keep API credentials out of commands
* File uploads use the eLabFTW upload endpoint with `multipart/form-data`
