## What is Python?

Python is a high‑level, interpreted programming language that was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum.  It reads almost like plain English, which makes it especially attractive for people whose primary expertise is not computer science (e.g. biologists, chemists, physicists, engineers).  

When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter reads the source code line‑by‑line, translates it into byte‑code, and executes it on the fly – you do not need a separate compilation step.

- Python gives you a clean, readable language that lets you focus on the scientific question rather than low‑level programming details.  
- Its extensive libraries let you go from raw data to publication‑quality figures in a few lines of code.  
- When performance becomes critical, you can combine Python with compiled extensions or off‑load heavy work to specialized tools.

## What is a Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web‑based document that combines executable code, rich text, plots, and multimedia in a single, linear layout.You open it in a browser, but the Python (or other language) kernel runs on your computer (or on a remote server) and evaluates each cell on demand.
Core concepts

- **Cells** – The notebook is divided into blocks called cells.  

  - **Code cells** contain Python (or R, Julia, …) statements that are sent to the kernel when you press **Shift + Enter**. The output—text, tables, images, interactive widgets—appears directly below the cell.  
  - **Markdown cells** hold formatted text written in **Markdown** (headings, lists, links, LaTeX equations, etc.). They let you annotate your analysis, describe the rationale, or document results.

- **Kernel** – A background process that executes the code. The notebook UI sends the cell’s source to the kernel, receives the result, and displays it. You can restart, interrupt, or switch kernels (e.g., Python 3, R) without leaving the notebook.

- **Output** – Anything that a normal REPL would print can appear: plain text, JSON, tables, Matplotlib/Plotly figures, HTML, LaTeX‑rendered equations, or interactive widgets (sliders, drop‑downs).

## Crash course: Python Basics

### 1. Printing & basic data types  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor note

These will be live coded in a Jupyter notebook.

TODO: ensure these all fit the narrative once it is all written.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```python
# Print a greeting
print("Hello, eLabFTW researcher!")

# Numbers, strings, booleans, which can be stored in variables
my_int   = 42            # integer
my_float = 3.14          # floating‑point
my_bool  = True          # boolean

print(my_int, my_float, my_bool)
```

**Expected output**  

```
Hello, eLabFTW researcher!
42 3.14 True
```

### 2. Variables & dynamic typing  

```python
a = 10          # a is an int
a = a * 2.5    # now a becomes a float (25.0)

print(a)
```

**Output**  

```
25.0
```

### 3. Lists (ordered collections)  

```python
samples = ["S1", "S2", "S3"]   # create a list
print(samples[0])              # first element → "S1"

# Append a new sample name
samples.append("S4")
print(samples)
```

**Output**  

```
S1
['S1', 'S2', 'S3', 'S4']
```

### 4. Loop over a list (for‑loop) to create a dictionary

```python
results = {}
for sample in samples:
    results[sample] = len(sample)   # store the length of the name

print(results)
```

**Output**  

```
{'S1': 2, 'S2': 2, 'S3': 2, 'S4': 2}
```

### 5. Conditional statements  

```python
threshold = 5
value = 7

if value > threshold:
    print("value is larger")
else:
    print("value is smaller or equal")
```

**Output**  

```
value is larger
```

### 6. Defining and calling a function  

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Return a friendly greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

**Output**  

```
Hello, Alice!
```  

### 7. Reading and writing JSON files  

```python
import json

payload = {"experiment": "test", "value": 123}

# Write to disk
with open("payload.json", "w") as fp:
    json.dump(payload, fp, indent=2)

# Read it back
with open("payload.json") as fp:
    data = json.load(fp)

print(data)
```

**Output**  

```
{'experiment': 'test', 'value': 123}
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
What will be printed?

```python
x = 5
x = "five"
print(x)
```

A. 5  
B. five  
C. TypeError  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

**B** – Python variables are dynamically typed; the second assignment overwrites the first.

## The eLabFTW Python API Library

One of the advantages of Python is that there are many ready-made libraries that allow us to easily reuse code others have created for a specific purpose.

For eLabFTW, there is **elabapi-python**. We can find information on it via the [API docs selection page](https://doc.elabftw.net/api/) by clicking `Python Library (v2)`.

Here, we can find some examples and information such as installation. We will do something similar to what the page says and install it directly via our Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
%pip install elabapi-python
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

This installs it directly in the environment we are working in so it is accessible to our notebook.

To install it locally (e.g., if you are working outside of the Jupyter environment), open a terminal window and install via pip. This usually looks like:

```bash
pip install elabapi-python
```

However, your Python and pip installation may use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

As indicated by the [elabapi-python installation instructions](https://github.com/elabftw/elabapi-python#installation), it is highly recommended to work in a virtual environment. We recommend [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for creating and managing these:

```bash
cd researcher_user
uv init --bare # initialize the project in the desired directory
uv add elabapi-python python-dotenv # add the API client and .env support
uv sync
```

The package `elabapi-python` is imported as `elabapi_python`, and
`python-dotenv` is imported as `dotenv` in `client.py`. Ensure you have added your credentials and the URL to a `.env` file.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Once downloaded, we need to import the library into our notebook or scripts:

```python
import elabapi_python
```

Python does not allow dashes, therefore, this is replaced with an underscore when calling the library.

To get basic help on any Python library in Jupyter, we can use the `help()` function. For example, to get help on the `elabapi_python` library, we can run:

```python
help(elabapi_python)
```

Honestly, for this specific case, the help output is not extremely helpful. However, it does give us some information on the library. We can also use the `dir()` function to get a list of all the functions in the library:

```python
dir(elabapi_python)
```

To get started, we have the [examples folder](https://github.com/elabftw/elabapi-python/tree/master/examples). Deltablot has created a nifty [client configuration file](https://github.com/elabftw/elabapi-python/blob/master/examples/client.py). This has already been downloaded and included in your `workshop_data` dir.

In the Python library, there are various clients that can be used to interact with the eLabFTW API. First, you set up the main one, which has already been done in `client.py`, then, you can create the others.

Import this into your notebook using:

```python
from workshop_data.research_computer.client import api_client
```

Let's look at a couple examples in the GitHub repo.

Check out [00_getting-started.py](https://github.com/elabftw/elabapi-python/blob/master/examples/00-getting-started.py). We can see an info client:

```python
info_client = elabapi_python.InfoApi(api_client)
api_response = info_client.get_info()
print(api_response)
```

In Jupyter Notebooks, we often get a pretty printed output, which is nice without using print(). This only works for the last line of a cell, so if you want to see the output of multiple lines or when using in a script, you will need to use print().

```python
api_response
```

Similarly, we can see an experiment client:

```python
exp_client = elabapi_python.ExperimentsApi(api_client)
```

Check out line 88, which shows us a get request. Remember how we created and retrieved an experiment in the CLI? Let's try the same thing here using the experiment ID from the last lesson.

```python
exp_id = 94 # example: replace with your experiment ID
exp = exp_client.get_experiment(exp_id)
print(exp)
```

You can see, this does the same things as we were doing before, but many of us find Python easier to read and understand than the CLI. This is especially true when we start to combine multiple steps into a single script.

We can derive the code from the documentation, as well, which is a great way to learn how to use the API. Check out the [API docs](https://doc.elabftw.net/api/) and click on `Python Library (v2)`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

What is the code for the client that interacts with resources in eLabFTW? Create this client in your notebook and use it to retrieve the resources from your eLabFTW instance.

Hint: Look through the [examples](https://github.com/elabftw/elabapi-python/tree/master/examples) and keep your eyes out for a different word than _resources_.


:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

An example can be found in [05-create-modify-item](https://github.com/elabftw/elabapi-python/blob/master/examples/05-create-modify-item.py) in line 6:

```python
itemsApi = elabapi_python.ItemsApi(api_client)
```

To retrieve and view all resources you have access to:

```python
resources = itemsApi.read_items()
resources
```
